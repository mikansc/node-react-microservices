#### Microservices with React ####


This is a simple system that I made during the [Microservices with Node JS and React](https://www.udemy.com/course/microservices-with-node-js-and-react/).

I`ll be using this repo as a base structure to my studies.

Feel free to contact me if you have any tips or questions. [This is my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelnsc/)


## Requirements ##

- You need Docker, Kubernetes and Skaffold to easily run this project

- [Skaffold page](https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/)
- [Docker page](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Kubernetes page](https://kubernetes.io/)


## How to run ##
- Just clone this repo and run `skaffold dev`. Skaffold will setup all the images and run the kubectl apply commands to create the kubernetes cluster.

You also need to edit your system's hosts file to access the project using http://posts.com address.

@ Windows
`C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts`

(I can't remember now how to reach the file at MacOS/Linux systems, sorry!)
